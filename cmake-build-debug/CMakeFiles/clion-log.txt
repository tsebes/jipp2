CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at matrixApp/CMakeLists.txt:9 (add_library):
  add_library cannot create target "matrixApp" because another target with
  the same name already exists.  The existing target is an executable created
  in source directory "C:/Users/sebiz/CLionProjects/jipp2/matrixApp".  See
  documentation for policy CMP0002 for more details.
